**HOW TO PLAY**

**Start of the game:**
- There are 2 teams - spies & good guys
- When the games starts each player is secretly told "You are a good guy" or "You are a spy".
- If you are a spy KEEP IT TO YOURSELF! - You need to deceive the good guys in order to win
- There are 5 missions - in order to win spies need to sabotage 3 out of 5 mission

**Before the mission:**
- Before each mission 1 player (the leader) chooses a team to go on the next mission
- After the leader chooses a team - everyone then votes to accept or reject the team
- If the team is rejected - a new leader is selected - they choose a new team - and the new team is voted on
- This process continues over and over until a team is accepted for the mission

**During the mission:**
- Once a team is accepted the mission starts
- Players on the team then vote to "Succeed" or "Fail" (sabotage) the mission
- If any player on the team votes to fail the mission the mission is failed (NOTE: mission 4 requires 2 no votes)
- Votes for the mission are anonymous - so no one knows who sabotaged the mission
    (if you are a good guy you always want the mission to succeed)

**End of the game:**
- The game ends when either spies or good guys have won 3 missions
